Nanos++ README for Chapel
=========================

This version of Nanos++ came from the git sourcetree with git ID
e3a0ce4913df42c2e4bbd291ae26f51c307f49df (e3a0ce4 for short).  It is a
snapshot that fell chronologically after official release 0.5 but
before 0.6 was ready due to differences in our release timing.  It was
cleared for use in this release by Alejandro Duran of the Nanos++ team
at Barcelona Supercomputing Center.  

Local modifications:

* We made one change to src/pms/chapel/chpl_main.cpp to move the
  #include "chpl_nanos.h" header down which was causing our older
  versions of gcc to choke.  (This same change has since been made
  in the Nanos++ source base).

* On 2011/04/20 we changed "chpltasks.h" to "chpl-tasks.h" in
  src/pms/chapel/chpl_nanos.h.

* We also made updates to the tasking interface to reflect new calls
  to create a dedicated communication task.

* Added the capability for the tasking layer to yield tasks in the
  event of active message calls by defining chpl_task_yield() and
  CHPL_COMM_YIELD_TASK_WHILE_POLLING.

* Added calls to store/read a task-private 'serial' bit and to use
  this bit to squash parallelism when requested/necessary.
